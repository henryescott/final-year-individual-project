# Final Year Individual Project
As part of the assessment for the CM2102 - Database Systems module that is studied by second year Computer Science undergraduates at Cardiff University, students are required to submit a piece of coursework whereby they write Oracle SQL queries to solve a given scenario, which are submitted in PDF format and marked manually.

This software tool extracts the Oracle SQL queries from the PDF documents and automatically determines their correctness, compared to model answers provided by the module leader.
